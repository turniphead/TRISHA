TRISHA (Teaching Robotics Intelligently in Schools and Homes on Android) is a robot designed to help students learn about programming and robotics. She is controlled from an Android phone or tablet, where users write simple "code" in the form of actions and logic elements. When the student presses Play, the application instantly sends the program to TRISHA over a bluetooth connection, and she immediately starts to execute the actions. She's able to drive around, blink her lights, play sounds, and sense her environment. If the student wants to change the program, there's no need to reflash and recompile code - simply press Play again and watch TRISHA go! Her animatronic design makes her more than just a robot - she's a friend that teaches. She's inspired by projects like LEGO Mindstorms, Scratch, and JKarel.
